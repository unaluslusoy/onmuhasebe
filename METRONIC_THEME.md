# Metronic 8 Theme Not Included

The `lisanstema/` directory contains the Metronic 8 admin theme but is excluded from git due to its large size (12,000+ files).

## Installation

1. **Purchase Metronic 8:**
   - https://keenthemes.com/products/metronic

2. **Extract to Project:**
   ```
   Extract Metronic 8 files to: /lisanstema/
   ```

3. **File Structure:**
   ```
   /lisanstema/
   └── /demo/
       ├── /assets/
       │   ├── /css/
       │   ├── /js/
       │   └── /media/
       └── [other demo files]
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Check: http://localhost/onmuhasebe/lisanstema/demo/
   - Should see Metronic demo pages

## Alternative (Free Bootstrap Template)

If you don't have Metronic, you can use free Bootstrap 5 admin templates:
- AdminLTE 3
- CoreUI
- SB Admin 2

## Current Status

✅ Application works without Metronic theme assets
✅ Views use CDN links for critical CSS/JS
❌ Full Metronic integration requires theme files
